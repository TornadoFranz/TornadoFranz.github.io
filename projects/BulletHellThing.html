						<h3> About the Game: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> 
			Bullet Hell Thing is an endless 2D bullet hell game where you have to fight off waves of enemies to maximize your highscore. </p>

		
					<h3> About the Development: </h3>
				
			<p class="introduction"> Bullet Hell thing was my 2. Semester project at the Games Academy. Originally we had a team of 7 people but during the course of the project.
			
1 programmer and 1 artist dropped out. The project started with a lot of organizational problems, we didn't have a producer so another programmer ending up filling in the job, so I had to do most programming by myself.

All aboard the team there seemed to be a lack of motivation for the project, short work hours and bad attendance left us with a really unpolished game.
At first i wasn't that hooked by our vision for this game, but creating different bullet patterns for the enemies actually turned out to be pretty fun.

All in all, the gamed turned out pretty unpolished and uninspired, but the gameplay wasn't all that bad. Definitely not as good as the first semester project.
