						<h3> About the Game: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> 
			Can't Stop Won't Stop is an 2D platformer game, where you are not able to directly control the character.
The players' goal is it to escort the character safely to the end of the level, by changing the environment around him.

					<h3> About the Development: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> 
In the holidays between my first and second semester I started working on the game
Can't Stop Won't Stop, the goal for me was to create a mobile game that I could
potentially release on the app store.
Due to the lack of mobile input possibilities I had the idea of a character
that the player would have to escort to the end of the level with
simple drag and drop mechanics of objects.
To my surprise, the game actually ended up demanding high and fast mechanical
abilities of the player which was fun to play on PC,
but felt really awful on mobile.
The more I worked on the game the more I lost interest to actually optimize it
as a mobile game and started to focus on PC, but without the motivation to
actually release the game I stopped working on it after my 2. Semester started.
I do think that the core mechanics of the game have certain potentials which I may
or may not revisit someday.
