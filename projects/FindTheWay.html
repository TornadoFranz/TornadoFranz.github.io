			<h3> About the Development: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> The whole purpose of this project for me was to create a game i actually can release on the play store. Therefore i thought of the most minimalistic game i could possibly create to finally finish a project. To give the player atleast a bit of purpose i then implemented a highscore system so you could measure your self with others. There is realy not much to say about this one. It's a small, casual, minimalistic mobile game. Its not much but its mine.  </p>
