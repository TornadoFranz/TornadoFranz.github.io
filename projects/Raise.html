					<h3> About the Development: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> For my last semester at the “Games-Academy” we worked in a group of 4. Because of the corona virus, we were forced to work remotely on the project. The biggest surprise about this project was how smooth it actually went. Even though we were all working remotely, it rarely caused problems. We held a meeting each morning at ten on discord, we hit all deadlines and the vision of the game was also pretty clear. For me personally, working alone at home is something that actually helped my productivity. On of the guidelines of the project was that we had to make a hyper casual game, and while none of originally had the motivation to do so, we all ended up enjoying working on the project.
