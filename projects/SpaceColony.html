						<h3> About the Game: </h3>

Space Colony is a building/strategy game in which the player connects modules to extend the Space Station. The players goal is to balance the resources at his disposal to create a lasting economy in Space. </p>

		
					<h3> About the Development: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> 
Space Colony was my 3. Semester project. 
Our team consisted of 7 people with 2 artists, 2 programmers, 2 game designer and 1 producer. 
It was originally planned to be a VR game, 
turns out creating a building/strategy game in VR comes with a lot of problems. 
We decided to drop the VR pretty late in development, 
since we didn't make much progress and had not much time left to finish the game. 
After having lost so much time on VR, it was pretty clear we would not achieve most of our scope.
In the end we had to cut a lot of stuff and ended up with more of a demo then an actual game.
To actually finish the game before the deadline we had to stay over the night. We finished the game at 4 AM in the morning, a few hours before the presentation.
