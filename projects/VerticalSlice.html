			<h1> Vertical Slice </h1>
			<h2> Unity / PC </h2>
						<h3> About the Game: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> 
Vertical Slice is a Tetris inspired platformer in 3D.
The player has to build a way to the top with Tetris blocks,
while simultaneously controlling a character with classic jump and run mechanics. </p>

		
					<h3> About the Development: </h3>
			<p class="introduction"> Vertical Slice was my first ever experience as a game Developer. The Game was made as my 1. Semester project, during my education at the “Games-Academy Berlin”.
As a group of 5 people we worked on the project bi-weekly over the course of 5 months, our team consisted of 2 artists, 2 game designers, and me as the only programmer.
Before this project my experience as a programmer and knowledge of game engines like unity were almost zero,
consequently, my personal learning curve during this time was my highest ever. Even though looking back now I get the urge to strangle my past self for the messy chunks of code I wrote, I never worked harder on something in my life
(prior to this project) and I am extremely proud of the personal progress I've made as a game developer during those 4 months.
I might be looking at this game through rose colored glasses because it was my first, but to this day Vertical Slice is in spite of all my shabby code, still one of my favorites.
